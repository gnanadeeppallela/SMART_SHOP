    Amazon's Report Infringement form is intended for use by intellectual property rights owners and their agents to notify Amazon of alleged intellectual property infringements such as copyright and trademark concerns. If you are not an intellectual property rights owner or their agent, Amazon will not be able to process complaints submitted through this form. Please report your concerns to Amazon through the appropriate venue:
  Sellers may use this contact us form to report inappropriate listings, other sellers, policy violations, etc.
  Buyers may use this contact us form to report problems with orders, seller policy violations, etc.

  We Do Not Enforce
  Detail Page Ownership and Image Restrictions: When a detail page is created, it becomes a permanent catalog page on Amazon.com that will remain even if the creator's inventory sells out. Additionally, when you add your copyrighted image to a detail page, you grant Amazon and its affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right to exercise all rights of publicity over the material.
  Other sellers can list their items for sale against pages that you have created or added your copyrighted images to. However, we do require sellers to list only against detail pages that exactly match their items. If you believe sellers are listing against detail pages that do not exactly match their items, we ask that you report the violation directly by using the contact us form.
  If your copyrighted image has been added to our catalog without your consent, please complete the form below.
  Exclusive or Selective Distribution: Amazon respects a manufacturer's right to enter into exclusive distribution agreements for its products. However, violations of such agreements do not constitute intellectual property rights infringement. As the enforcement of these agreements is a matter between the manufacturer and the retailers, it would not be appropriate for Amazon to assist in enforcement activities.
  To access Amazon's Report Infringement form please sign in or create your Amazon account.
